# Spawning
Creating new Splurgs is called spawning and can happen in 2 ways
## Hives
Hives will spawn random Splurgs providing they have enough energy
## Splurg Breeding
When 2 Splurgs meet, providing they have enough energy they will spawn a new Splurg.
This Splurg is mostly random, however if the two parent Splurgs share a common attribute value then the
new spawn will inherit that attribute value.
